* Reduce memory footprint of the whole implementation (on 1kk set it's taking 21
GiBs just for data)
* Analyze how well graph will get reduced
* Create code for determining distinct sets on a graph (making it a forest)
* Reduce each graph from forest
* Perform FW algorithm to create distance matrix
* Perform MDS to fill gaps in a distance matrix
* Present results
* Make a simple content-based recommendation system
